/*
Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ï¿½

// const weightJohn = 92;
// const heightMark = 1.69;
// const weightMark = 78;
// const heightJohn = 1.95;

const weightMark = 95;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const weightJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const bmiMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2
const bmiJohn = weightJohn / heightJohn ** 2;
console.log(bmiMark, bmiJohn)

if (bmiMark > bmiJohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${bmiMark}) is higher than John's (${bmiJohn})!`);
} else {
